/// The widget tree.
///
/// The widget tree manages all UI components and rendering on the terminal, i.e. the whole
/// terminal is the root widget node, everything inside is the children nodes, and can recursively
/// go down.
///
/// Each widget node inside the tree can contain 0 or more children nodes.
///
/// # Terms
///
/// * Parent: The parent node.
/// * Child: The child node.
/// * Ancestor: Either the parent, or the parent of some ancestor of the node.
/// * Descendant: Either the child, or the child of some descendant of the node.
/// * Sibling: Other children nodes under the same parent.
///
/// # Guarantees
///
/// ## Ownership
///
/// Parent owns all its children.
///
/// * Children will be destroyed when their parent is.
/// * Coordinate system are relative to their parent's top-left corner, while the absolute
///   coordinates are based on the terminal's top-left corner.
/// * Children are displayed inside their parent's geometric shape, clipped by boundaries. While
///   the size of each node can be logically infinite on the imaginary canvas.
/// * The `visible` and `enabled` attributes of a child are implicitly inherited from it's
///   parent, unless they're explicitly been set.
///
/// ## Priority
///
/// Children have higher priority than their parent to both display and process input events.
///
/// * Children are always displayed on top of their parent, and has higher priority to process
///   a user's input event when the event occurs within the shape of the child. The event will
///   fallback to their parent if the child doesn't process it.
/// * For children that shade each other, the one with higher z-index has higher priority to
///   display and process the input events.
///
/// # Attributes
///
/// ## Shape (position and size)
///
/// A shape can be relative/logical or absolute/actual, and always rectangle. The position is by
/// default relative to its parent top-left corner, and the size is by default logically
/// infinite. While rendering to the terminal device, we need to calculate its absolute position
/// and actual size.
///
/// There're two kinds of positions:
/// * Relative: Based on it's parent's position.
/// * Absolute: Based on the terminal device.
///
/// There're two kinds of sizes:
/// * Logical: An infinite size on the imaginary canvas.
/// * Actual: An actual size bounded by it's parent's actual shape, if it doesn't have a parent,
///   bounded by the terminal device's actual shape.
///
/// The shape boundary uses top-left open, bottom-right closed interval. For example the
/// terminal shape is `((0,0), (10,10))`, the top-left position `(0,0)` is inclusive, i.e.
/// inside the shape, the bottom-right position `(10,10)` is exclusive, i.e. outside the shape.
/// The width and height of the shape is both `10`.
///
/// The absolute/actual shape is calculated with a "copy-on-write" policy. Based on the fact
/// that a widget's shape is often read and rarely modified, thus the "copy-on-write" policy to
/// avoid too many duplicated calculations. i.e. we always calculates a widget's absolute
/// position and actual size right after it's shape is been changed, and also caches the result.
/// Thus we simply get the cached results when need.
///
/// ## Z-index
///
/// The z-index arranges the display priority of the content stack when multiple children
/// overlap on each other, a widget with higher z-index has higher priority to be displayed. For
/// those widgets have the same z-index, the later inserted one will cover the previous inserted
/// ones.
///
/// The z-index only works for the children under the same parent. For a child widget, it always
/// covers/overrides its parent display.
/// To change the visibility priority between children and parent, you need to change the
/// relationship between them.
///
/// For example, now we have two children under the same parent: A and B. A has 100 z-index, B
/// has 10 z-index. Now B has a child: C, with z-index 1000. Even the z-index 1000 > 100 > 10, A
/// still covers C, because it's a sibling of B.
///
/// ## Visible and enabled
///
/// A widget can be visible or invisible. When it's visible, it handles user's input events,
/// processes them and updates the UI contents. When it's invisible, it's just like not existed,
/// so it doesn't handle or process any input events, the UI hides.
///
/// A widget can be enabled or disabled. When it's enabled, it handles input events, processes
/// them and updates the UI contents. When it's disabled, it's just like been fronzen, so it
/// doesn't handle or process any input events, the UI keeps still and never changes.
