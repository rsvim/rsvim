//! Coordinate system conversions between children widgets and their parent widget.
//!
//! A widget's shape is always a rectangle, and it's position is the top-left corner of the
//! rectangle.
//!
//! There're two kinds of positions:
//! * Relative: Based on it's parent's position.
//! * Absolute: Based on the terminal device.
//!
//! There're two kinds of sizes:
//! * Logical: An infinite size on the imaginary canvas.
//! * Actual: An actual size bounded by it's parent's actual shape, if it doesn't have a parent,
//!   bounded by the terminal device's actual shape.
//!
//! Note:
//! 1. If a widget doesn't have a parent (i.e. it's the root widget), the relative position is
//!    already absolute.
//! 2. If the relative/logical shape is outside of it's parent or the terminal, it will be
//!    automatically bounded inside of it's parent or the terminal's shape.
