/// The viewport for a buffer.
///
/// There are several factors affecting the final display effects when a window showing a buffer:
///
/// 1. Window (display) options (such as ['wrap'](crate::defaults::win),
///    ['line-break'](crate::defaults::win)), they decide how does the line in the buffer renders
///    in the window.
/// 2. ASCII control codes and unicode, they decide how does a character renders in the window.
///
/// ## Case-1: Line-wrap and word-wrap
///
/// ### Case-1.1: Wrap is disabled
///
/// When 'wrap' option is `false`, and there's one very long line which is longer than the width
/// of the window. The viewport has to truncate the line, and only shows part of it. For example:
///
/// Example-1
///
/// ```text
/// |-------------------------------------|
/// |This is the beginning of the very lon|g line, which only shows the beginning part.
/// |-------------------------------------|
/// ```
///
/// Example-2
///
/// ```text
///                                           |---------------------------------------|
/// This is the beginning of the very long lin|e, which only shows the beginning part.|
/// This is the short line, it's not shown.   |                                       |
/// This is the second very long line, which s|till shows in the viewport.            |
///                                           |---------------------------------------|
/// ```
///
/// Example-1 only shows the beginning of the line, and example-2 only shows the ending of the
/// line (with 'wrap' option is `false`, the second line is too short to show in viewport).
///
/// ### Case-1.2: Wrap is enabled
///
/// When 'wrap' option is `true`, the long line will take multiple rows and try to use the whole
/// window to render all of it, while still been truncated if it's just too long to show within the
/// whole window. For example:
///
/// Example-3
///
/// ```text
/// |-------------------------------------|
/// |This is the beginning of the very lon|
/// |g line, which only shows the beginnin|
/// |g part.                              |
/// |-------------------------------------|
/// ```
///
/// Example-4
///
/// ```text
///  This is the beginning of the very lon
/// |-------------------------------------|
/// |g line, which only shows the beginnin|
/// |g part? No, even it sets `wrap=true`,|
/// | it is still been truncated because t|
/// |-------------------------------------|
///  he whole window cannot render it.
/// ```
///
/// Example-3 shows `wrap=true` can help a window renders the very long line if the window itself
/// is big enough. And example-4 shows the very long line will still be truncated if it's too long.
///
/// ## Case-2: ASCII control codes and unicodes
///
/// Most characters use 1 cell width in the terminal, such as alphabets (A-Z), numbers (0-9) and
/// punctuations. But ASCII control codes can use 2 or more cells width. For example:
///
/// ### Case-2.1: ASCII control codes
///
/// Example-5
///
/// ```text
/// ^@^A^B^C^D^E^F^G^H<--HT-->
/// ^K^L^M^N^O^P^Q^R^S^T^U^V^W^X^Y^Z^[^\^]^^^_
/// ```
///
/// Example-5 shows how ASCII control codes render in Vim. Most of them use 2 cells width, except
/// horizontal tab (HT, 9) renders as 8 spaces (shows as `<--HT-->` in the example), and line feed
/// (LF, 10) renders as empty, i.e. 0 cell width, it just starts a new line.
///
/// Some unicode, especially Chinese/Japanese/Korean, can use 2 cells width as well. For example:
///
/// Example-6
///
/// ```text
/// 你好，Vim！
/// こんにちは、Vim！
/// 안녕 Vim!
/// ```
///
/// ### Case-2.2: Unicode and CJK
///
/// ## Case-3: All together
///
/// Taking all above scenarios into consideration, when rendering a buffer in a viewport, some edge
/// cases are:
///
/// Example-7
///
/// ```text
///                                  31(LF)
/// 0  3 4                   24    30|
/// |  | |                   |      ||
///     |---------------------|
/// <--H|T-->This is the first| line.                 <- Line-1
/// This| is the second line. |                       <- Line-2
/// This| is the third line, 它 有一点点长。          <- Line-3
///     |---------------------|
/// |  |                     | |          |||
/// 0  3                     24|         36||
///                            25         37|
///                                         38(LF)
/// ```
///
/// Example-7 shows a use case with 'wrap' option is `false`, at the beginning of the first line in
/// the viewport, the horizontal tab (`<--HT-->`, use 8 cells width) cannot been fully rendered in
/// viewport. And at the end of the last line in the viewport, the Chinese character (`它`, use 2
/// cells width) also cannot been fully rendered in viewport.
///
/// For the _**display column**_ in the buffer, it's based on the display width of the unicode
/// character, not the char index in the buffer. In example-7, line-1, the start display column is
/// 4 (the `T` in the `<--HT-->`, inclusive), the end display column is 25 (the ` ` whitespace
/// after the `t`, exclusive). In line-3, the start display column is 4 (the ` ` whitespace after
/// the `s`, inclusive), the end display column is 25 (the right half part in the `它` character,
/// exclusive).
///
/// Another hidden rule is:
/// 1. When 'wrap' option is `false`, there can be multiple lines start from non-zero columns in
///    the buffer, or end at non-ending position of the line. Just like example-7, there are 3
///    lines and they all start from column 4, and for line-1 and line-3 they don't end at their
///    ending position of the line.
/// 2. When 'wrap' option is `true`, there will be at most 1 line start from non-zero columns, or
///    end at non-ending position of the line in the buffer. For example:
///
/// Example-8
///
/// ```text
/// 0  3 4  <- Column index in the line of the buffer.
/// |  | |
///     |---------------------|
/// <--H|T-->This is the first|
///     | line. It is quite lo|
///     |ng and even cannot <-|-HT--> be fully rendered in viewport.
///     |---------------------|
///      |                 ||
///      46               64|   <- Column index in the line of the buffer.
///                         65
/// ```
///
/// The example-8 shows a very long line that cannot be fully rendered in the viewport, both start
/// and ending parts are been truncated. But there will not be 2 lines that are both truncated,
/// because with 'wrap' options is `true`, if one line is too long to render, only the one line
/// will show in the viewport. If one line is not too lone and there could be another line, then at
/// least for the first line, it can be fully rendered in the viewport, and it must starts from the
/// first char of the line (as 'wrap' option requires this rendering behavior).
///
/// But what if there're characters cannot been rendered in 2nd row end in example-8? for example:
///
/// Example-9
///
/// ```text
/// 0  3 4  <- Column index in the line of the buffer.
/// |  | |
///     |---------------------|
/// <--H|T-->This is the first|
///     | line. It is quite<--|
///     |HT-->long and even ca|nnot <--HT--> be fully rendered in viewport.
///     |---------------------|
///      |    |              |
///      43   44             59   <- Column index in the line of the buffer.
/// ```
///
/// The above example is a variant from example-8, in the 2nd row end, the tab (`<--HT-->`, uses 8
/// cells width) char cannot be fully rendered. Vim doesn't allow such cases, i.e. when 'wrap'
/// option is `true`, the non-fully rendering only happens at the beginning (top left corner) of
/// viewport, and at the end (bottom right corner) of viewport. It cannot happens inside the
/// viewport. Vim forces the tab char to render in the next row. When 'wrap' option is `false`,
/// each row handles exactly one line on their own, including the non-fully rendering.
///
/// Example-10
///
/// ```text
/// 0  3 4  <- Column index in the line of the buffer.
/// |  | |
///     |---------------------|
/// <--H|T-->This is the first|
///     | line. It is quite___|
///     |<--HT-->long and even| cannot <--HT--> be fully rendered in viewport.
///     |---------------------|
///      |       |           |
///      43      44          56   <- Column index in the line of the buffer.
/// ```
///
/// The above example is a variant from example-9, when 'wrap' is `true`, in the 2nd row end, the 3
/// cells cannot place the tab char, so move it to the next row.
///
/// Finally, some most important anchors (in a viewport) are:
///
/// - `start_line`: The start line (inclusive) of the buffer, it is the first line shows at the top
///   row of the viewport.
/// - `start_dcolumn`: The start display column (inclusive) of the buffer, it is the the first cell
///   of a line displayed in the viewport.
/// - `start_filled_cols`: The filled columns at the beginning of the row in the viewport, it is
///   only useful when the first char in a line doesn't show at the first column of the top row in
///   the viewport (because the previous char cannot be fully placed within these cells).
/// - `end_line`: The end line (exclusive) of the buffer, it is next to the last line at the bottom
///   row of the viewport.
/// - `end_dcolumn`: The end display column (exclusive) of the buffer, it is next to the last cell
///   of a line displayed in the viewport.
/// - `end_filled_cols`: The filled columns at the end of the row in the viewport, it is only
///   useful when the last char in a line doesn't show at the last column at the bottom row in the
///   viewport (because the following char cannot be fully placed within these cells).
///
/// NOTE: The _**display column**_ in the buffer is the characters displayed column index, not the
/// char index of the buffer, not the cell column of the viewport/window. It's named `dcolumn`
/// (short for `displayed_column`).
///
