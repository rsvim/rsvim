//! Pointers for UI tree.
//!
//! WARNING: These pointers are only allowed to be used inside the UI tree and widgets. The
//! scenario is: when some widgets want to access the data located in the tree or other nodes, the
//! widgets will have to contains a pointer/reference to the tree.
//! This is actually safe because all the widget nodes are managed by the tree. The only dangerous
//! case is: a widget is been removed from the tree, thus the tree pointer/reference held by this
//! widget is no longer valid.
