## About

The goal of RSVIM is to follow the philosophy of the VIM editor, but also to be:

- A powerful TUI engine similar to GUI frameworks that provides widgets, event handlers, MVC, etc.
- A programmable editor that provides a consistent scripting runtime environment, with built-in support for type system, async, plugin manager, etc.
- A background editing service that allows multiple remote clients to access and work together.
- A text processing tool that batch processes text contents.
- A modern project that leverages community works for theme, documentation, development, etc.
