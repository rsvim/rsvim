The goal of RSVIM is to following the philosophy of the VIM editor, but reinvents below aspects:

- To be a powerfull TUI engine similar to GUI frameworks such as [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) and [Tk](https://tkdocs.com/), provides widgets, event handler, MVC, etc.
- To be a programmable editor as a VM, provides a consistent scripting runtime environment, with built-in support for async and modern plugin package manager.
- To be a text processing tool, allows batch processing text contents.
- To be a background editing service, allows multiple clients to remotely access to work together.
- To be modern and popular, leveraging community works for: script, theme, documentation, development, etc.
